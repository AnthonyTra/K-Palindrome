# Lab 4

## Overview
For this project I am going to create a program that solves the k-palindrome problem. A palindrome is a string that is the same forwards as it is backwards. To solve this problem, you will need to determine if a provided string can be a palindrome by removing at most k characters. For example, ```asbghbsa``` can be a palindrome if you remove either the ```g``` or the ```h``` and so it is a valid 1-palindrome.  

### Completing the is_palindrome_iterative function
This function will take a string as an argument and return ```True``` if the string is a palindrome and ```False``` if it is not. This function must determine if the string is a palindrome iteratively, that is using for and/or while loops.


### Completing the is_palindrome_recursive function
This function will take a string as an argument and return ```True``` if the string is a palindrome and ```False``` if it is not. This function must determine if the string is a palindrome recursivly, that is by making calls to itself, each time reducing the size of the problem. 

### Completing the is_k_palindrome function
This function will take two arguments. The first will be the string that is being checked, and the second will be the value for k. 



### Completing the interactive component
In ```kpalindrome.py``` write a program that will ask the user for two inputs. The first will be a string, and the second will be an integer that will be used for k.
